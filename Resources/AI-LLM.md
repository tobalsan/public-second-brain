# Resources on AI and LLMs

## Prompts and System Instructions

- [Optimizing Coding Agent Rules (CLAUDE.md, agents.md, ./clinerulesm .cursor/rules) for Improved Accuracy - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/optimizing-coding-agent-rules-claude-md-agents-md-clinerules-cursor-rules-for-improved-accuracy/)
- [microsoft/agent-lightning: The absolute trainer to light up AI agents.](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning) - Train your agents without the overhead of a classic full SFT/RL setup

## Memory
- [AgentDB - Ultra-Fast Vector Database for AI Agents | AgentDB](https://agentdb.ruv.io/) - Instant memory. Local learning.  Global coordination. A sub-millisecond memory engine built for autonomous agents with 29 MCP tools for seamless AI integration.
	- I think it would be very interesting to set up an agent with this and give it my personal "therapy" conversations I had with LLMs.

## Coding Agents Tooling
- [numman-ali/openskills: Universal skills loader for AI coding agents - npm i -g openskills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) - Super cool, use Claude skills but with any coding agent.
- [cased/kit: The toolkit for AI devtools context engineering. Build with codebase mapping, symbol extraction, and many kinds of code search.](https://github.com/cased/kit) - Looks like a solid alternative to using AST-grep + Repomix or Gitingest to get an agent to know your codebase.

## General Principles
- [Build to Last — Chris Lattner talks with Jeremy Howard - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJS2YDZO-vc) - Super interesting conversation. Chris Lattner (creator of LLVM, Swift, and Mojo) and Jeremy Howard (founder of Fast.ai, inventor of first LLM) discuss why rushing to AI-generated code might be destroying code craftsmanship.
- [X post - Notes on how @linear thinks about AI agents: "The best automation starts with manual processes". They went from keyword search → semantic search → full agentic loops](https://x.com/jxnlco/status/1980624372936159315)
