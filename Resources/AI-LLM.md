# Resources on AI and LLMs

## Prompts and System Instructions

- [Optimizing Coding Agent Rules (CLAUDE.md, agents.md, ./clinerulesm .cursor/rules) for Improved Accuracy - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/optimizing-coding-agent-rules-claude-md-agents-md-clinerules-cursor-rules-for-improved-accuracy/)

## Memory
- [AgentDB - Ultra-Fast Vector Database for AI Agents | AgentDB](https://agentdb.ruv.io/) - Instant memory. Local learning.  Global coordination. A sub-millisecond memory engine built for autonomous agents with 29 MCP tools for seamless AI integration.
	- I think it would be very interesting to set up an agent with this and give it my personal "therapy" conversations I had with LLMs.

## Coding
- [numman-ali/openskills: Universal skills loader for AI coding agents - npm i -g openskills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) - Super cool, use Claude skills but with any coding agent

## General Principles
- [Build to Last — Chris Lattner talks with Jeremy Howard - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJS2YDZO-vc) - Super interesting conversation. Chris Lattner (creator of LLVM, Swift, and Mojo) and Jeremy Howard (founder of Fast.ai, inventor of first LLM) discuss why rushing to AI-generated code might be destroying code craftsmanship
